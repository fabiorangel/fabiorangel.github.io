    summary: |
      I hold a B.S. in Computer Science from the Federal University 
      of Rio de Janeiro (2015), and a M.S. from the Graduate Program 
      in Informatics at the same university (2017). My research was 
      associated with Machine Learning in Nonstationary Environments, 
      focused on Semi-Supervised and Online Learning. 
      Currently, I am a Data Science Specialist at Winnin Inc, optimizing 
      machine learning models, statistical models, and developing 
      solutions that use LLM models. 

      I have a previous experience in marketing science working as 
      Data Scientist at the Media Intelligence Center for Coca-Cola, 
      also leading the Business Intelligence team for two years. 
      I was a part-time lecturer at UFRJ, teaching Python Programming, 
      Linear Algebra, Computational Intelligence, and Data Science.
